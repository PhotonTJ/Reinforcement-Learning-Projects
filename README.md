# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository contains various **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** projects, primarily focused on **policy gradient methods** and **actor-critic networks**, implemented and tested on the `Hopper-v4` environment from OpenAI Gym.

Each project is based on a notable research paper and includes a comprehensive walkthrough explaining the methodology, implementation, and performance.
